## DiSiR (Dimer Signal Receptor Analysis) : the Streamlit app ##

This is a [CellPhoneDB](https://github.com/ventolab/CellphoneDB)-like framework to quickly look up individual ligand-receptor interactions and get publication-ready heatmaps (instead of running it on the whole database and then parsing the output). Currently, only the mtx/genes/annotation format is accepted. If there is interest, we plan on accomodating h5ad and h5Seurat formats.

The app is hosted for free [here](https://share.streamlit.io/akurlovs/disir_app/main/disir_app.py), kudos to [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Given that it's free, it is only able to accommodate small datasets for now.

Please send your questions to Andre Kurlovs (a.kurlovs@gmail.com) if you have any questions or concerns. The app is based on the work by Milad Vahid (who wrote most of the code) and Andre Kurlovs (who helped with the code and produced the visualizations/app) at [Sanofi US](https://www.sanofi.com).
