## DiSiR (Dimer Signal Receptor Analysis) : the Streamlit app ##

Please send your questions to Andre Kurlovs (a.kurlovs@gmail.com) if you have any questions or concerns. The app is based on the work by Milad Vahid and Andre Kurlovs at [Sanofi US](https://www.sanofi.com).

Currently, only the mtx/genes/annotation format is accepted. If there is interest, we plan on accomodating h5ad and h5Seurat formats.
